# 6.009 Remix

Creative extensions of [6.009](https://py.mit.edu) labs (SOEMHTING OF MY OWNWNNNN)

## Fall 2020 labs

Here are the names of each lab and my ideas for extending each

### 0: Audio Processing

- Write a script that splits an audio file (i.e. an acapella song into individual words, ideally), reverses them, then stitches them back together
- (The funnier but potentially unfeasible idea is to detect the words and alphabetically order the audio clips)
- And/or implement in a programming language other than Python
- Handle file formats other than .wav ([possible starter reference](https://hackernoon.com/audio-handling-basics-how-to-process-audio-files-using-python-cli-jo283u3y))
- Something inspired by acapella/choir: singing in rounds, harmonies, etc.

### 1: Image Processing 1

- Make a GUI or script for cropping I often need to do but is inconvenient in Preview (e.g. move a fixed-aspect-ratio selection box around)
- Surreal gen Z meme generator by composing random elements/backgrounds/WordArt together

### 2: Image Processing 2

- Thicken noisy parts of image
- [Snapdragon](https://github.com/katmh/snapdragon) v2 >:)
 
### 3: Bacon Number

Something with a JS data viz framework and social network or humorous data

### 4: Frugal Maps

Implement in JS/Mapbox or apply to creative path/geographic data

### 5: Minesweeper

Try doing some other recursion-heavy project

Minesweeper but it brings you in until you hit a bomb, then you return out a level?

### 6: SAT Solver

Make a website that solves Boolean satisfiability problems around pop culture topics

### 7: Autocorrect

Explorable explanation >:)

### 8: Symbolic Algebra

Website that solves those Instagram emoji math problems (maybe it reads them in with OCR too)

### 9: LISP 1

Make a LISP using a LISP

### 10: LISP 2
